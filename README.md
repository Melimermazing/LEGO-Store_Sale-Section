# LEGO® Store | Sale Section
REBOOT LABS - Database Design Project

# Project Description 

Nowadays, the concept of an online store is gaining popularity. It provides a user-friendly way of browsing products, and it is also possible to view different products under a category.

For example, in LEGO® marketplace, customers can see the complete LEGO® sets. However, there is a large number of parts in one set. 

So, we are deciding to develop the database system for a sale section of LEGO® online store. The aspects of a sale section that we are developing will be related to the products in real life LEGO® marketplace [BrickLink](https://www.bricklink.com).
